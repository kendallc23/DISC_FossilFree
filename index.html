    <h2> Our Mission </h2>
    <p class="mission-statement">
Fossil Free Northwestern is a group of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community members calling on Northwestern University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels and reinvest in the Evanston community and in life-giving institutions. We see divestment as a tactic for moving money within the larger goal of a just transition towards a regenerative economy.
    </p>
    <p class="mission-statement">
      Divestment is a tactic with a long history against injustice, including the movement to end South African apartheid, the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and the Indigenous-led divestment initiative of the #NoDAPl movement to get banks and other financial institutions to stop funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. We also stand with the rich history of demands from Black abolitionists to divest from the Military and Prison Industrial Complex.  
    </p>
    <p class="mission-statement">
Fossil Free Northwestern is part of an international divestment movement made up of colleges, cities, religious institutions, and more all taking action against climate change by removing funds, resources, and energy from the corporations and institutions upholding and perpetuating global racial capitalism. Beyond divestment, we aim to support and uplift environmental justice fights around the world, leveraging our power as members of a prestigious university to further movements for justice and liberation.
